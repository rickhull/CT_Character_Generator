CT_Character_Tools
==================

Use Cases
=========

Removed several use cases. This program is just to create NPCs.
Something else will use the basics and be able to edit characters.

UC.1  Create a new character from scratch. 
UC.5  Run dual careers (Navy and Noble). 
UC.7  Output to XML, JSON, Wiki, CSV, HTML, Neo4J, SQL. 


Classes and Modules
===================
Class Character
  Holds data like UPP, Gender, Name, Skills, Equipment.
  Mostly a data structure with the "generate" method.
  The to_s needs to go into Presenter.
  run_career needs to go away, or into CharacterTools.rb
    run_career is the big issue right now.

Module CharacterTools
  Methods to generate character data.

Module Presenter
  Methods to format output. 

Class Career
  Methods to modify a character based on career choises.
Class <Career>
  Attributes of the specified career.

Program Flow
============

This needs work. My gut feel is that I'm missing the OOP idea and have
too many steps. Yet I don't know enough OOP to be sure.

  Chargen
    Get available careers
    Get options
    Class Character
      Character.new
      Character.generate
    Set terms based on -t option or random.
    == The basic character should not have a career.
    == Terms should actually go after this.

    Add a single term of the Social Career if not already a career.
    For each career in the character.careers hash
      Class Career
      Class <Career>
        Modify the character based on Methods and attributes of 
        Class <Career>

    Display the resulting character on the screen 
    == PresenterSQL is a start on a new topic. Can be ignored for now.
